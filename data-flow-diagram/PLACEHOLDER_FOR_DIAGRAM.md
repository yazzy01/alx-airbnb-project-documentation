# Placeholder for data-flow.png

A file named `data-flow.png` should be created using Draw.io following the instructions in the DFD_INSTRUCTIONS.md file and placed in this directory.

The diagram should be a high-resolution (at least 1920x1080) PNG export of a Data Flow Diagram that illustrates how data moves through the AirBnB Clone system, including:

1. External entities (Guest, Host, Admin, Payment Gateway, etc.)
2. Core processes (User Authentication, Property Management, Booking, etc.)
3. Data stores (User DB, Properties DB, Bookings DB, etc.) 
4. Data flows between these components with clear labels

Once created, the PNG file should be named `data-flow.png` and committed to this directory.
